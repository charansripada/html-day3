<h1>Triumph</h1>
<p>When <b>Triumph</b>  Engineering went into receivership in 1983, <small>John Bloor</small>  bought the name and manufacturing rights from the Official Receiver. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_Motorcycles_Ltd">former company's </a>manufacturing plant was outdated and unable to compete against the <sup> technology</sup> from Japanese manufacturers, so Bloor decided against relaunching the brand immediately. Initially, production of the <ins>old Triumph Bonneville was continued under licence by Les Harris of Racing Spares,</ins> in Newton <q> Abbot, Devon, to bridge the gap <sub> between</sub> the end of the old company </q><del> and the</del> start of a new one. For five years from 1983, <em>about 14 a week were built at peak production.</em> <mark> They were never imported into the United States due to problems with liability insurance.[5]</mark> </p>
